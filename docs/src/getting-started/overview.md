To begin, *Stylus* ships with a number of [examples](examples/general/README.md) that can be found in the [source bundle](https://github.com/mmastrac/stylus/archive/master.zip). Copy the `simple_network` folder to a location of your choice. In this guide we will assume that it will appear in `~/stylus/`.

Once you've got the example set up locally, we can walk though... 

* [Running Stylus](running.md)
* [Creating a Stylus Project](creating-project.md)
* [Creating Monitors](creating-monitors.md)
* [Creating Monitor Pages](creating-pages.md)
* [Configuration](../configuration/server/README.md)
* [Advanced Configuration](../configuration/advanced.md)
