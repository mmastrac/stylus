# Creating Monitor Pages

**Stylus** is designed to be flexible and gives you a lot (too much?) freedom in
how you configure your display.

**Stylus** works particularly well with
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) diagrams, but can
use any markup language that supports either CSS or dynamic updates via JSON
data (eg: Angular, React, etc).

There are number of provided hooks for updating status, and depending on which
technology you'd like to use for your status page, you can choose which one
makes sense:

## CSS

## JSON

## HTML
